# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is a simple weather application built with React and Vite. It allows users to search for a city and get the current weather conditions for that location.

## Installation


To run this application locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you've cloned this repository, navigate to the project directory and run the following commands:
